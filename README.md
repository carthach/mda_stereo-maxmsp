# MDA Stereo for Max/MSP
mda_stereo~ is a port of the MDA Stereo plugin for Max/MSP that uses the Haas delay effect and comb filtering.

## Install
Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/carthach/mda_stereo-maxmsp/releases).

Drop anywhere into your Max path.

On Mac you'll probably need to clear the quarantine attributes:

`sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine <external_location>`


## Building
Get the [max-sdk](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk)

Clone the repo into the `source/audio`, or if you want to clone it elsewhere adjust max-pretarget.cmake and max-posttarget.cmake in CMakeLists.txt.

Rename the repo folder to mda_stereo~ (the max-sdk uses that name for the project name)

Then follow the instructions for [Mac](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk#mac) or [Windows](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk#Windows).

Note: for new Macs you need to build a universal binary 
`cmake -G Xcode .. "-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64;arm64"`

## Continuous Integration
The GitHub Actions script shows how a Max external can be build for both platforms automatically on each commit. Releases can be generated by pushing a tag.
